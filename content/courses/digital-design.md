## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to digital logic design, covering combinational and sequential circuits, finite state machines, and FPGA implementation. Students will gain hands-on experience with hardware description languages (VHDL/Verilog) and modern design tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and analyze combinational and sequential digital circuits
- Implement digital systems using hardware description languages
- Use FPGA development tools for synthesis and simulation
- Apply systematic design methodologies to complex digital systems
- Debug and verify digital circuits using industry-standard techniques

## Prerequisites

- Introduction to Programming
- Basic Circuit Analysis
- Discrete Mathematics
