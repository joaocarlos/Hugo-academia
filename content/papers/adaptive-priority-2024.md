## Abstract

This paper presents an adaptive priority scheduling algorithm for MQTT-based urban monitoring systems. Our approach enables sensors to dynamically adjust message priorities based on threshold detection and environmental conditions, improving response times for critical events while maintaining efficient bandwidth utilization.

## Key Contributions

-   Novel adaptive priority algorithm for MQTT brokers
-   Dynamic threshold detection mechanism
-   Extensive simulation results demonstrating 40% improvement in critical event response times
-   Real-world deployment in urban traffic monitoring scenario
