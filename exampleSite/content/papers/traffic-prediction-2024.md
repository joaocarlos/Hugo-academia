## Abstract

We present a novel deep learning architecture for predicting urban traffic patterns using multi-modal sensor data. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic flow. Experiments on real-world datasets from three major cities demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by 15% in prediction accuracy while reducing computational requirements by 40%.
