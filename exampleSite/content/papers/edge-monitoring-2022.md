## Abstract

Real-time environmental monitoring requires processing large volumes of sensor data with minimal latency. This paper presents an edge computing architecture that performs local data processing and anomaly detection, reducing cloud bandwidth requirements by 80% while enabling sub-second response times for critical events.
