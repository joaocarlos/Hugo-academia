## Project Overview

The Smart Urban Monitoring Network (SUMN) is a large-scale research project aimed at deploying and managing a city-wide network of environmental sensors. The project combines cutting-edge IoT hardware with advanced machine learning algorithms to provide real-time insights into urban environmental conditions.

## Objectives

1. Deploy 1,000+ environmental sensors across San Francisco
2. Develop adaptive sensing algorithms to optimize data collection
3. Create predictive models for air quality and noise pollution
4. Provide open data access to researchers and city planners

## Key Results

- Successfully deployed 500 sensors in pilot phase
- Achieved 99.5% uptime with solar-powered nodes
- Reduced false alarm rate by 75% using ML-based anomaly detection
- Published 5 peer-reviewed papers from project findings
